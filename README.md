# Math-EE-Cellular-Automata-Traffic-Flow-Sim

This is a program that simulates Nagel-Schreckenberg's Cellular Automata traffic flow model in python.
It outputs a png image of the simulation's results to the desired filepath on your computer.

Requires Cage, which is responsible for cellular automata simulations. (http://www.alcyone.com/software/cage/)
It seems that the download link is down. I have the cage.py file included in this repository for convenience.
